# Home Page

This is the repository I use to track and 
build www.possing.tech.

The webpage uses node and it's really just a launching
point for me to be able to serve up all sorts of things.

## Build Instructions

The website does require a little of building before
it can run. 

Be sure to run `npm run scss` to compile the 
css for the page. `scss` runs the `build.js` script in the
scss folder.
