            There are other people you could hire to to that! And what they do is very interesting. I'm the guy you hire
            when you need inspired architectural design and solutions to problems. You will find me ready to adapt and
            overcome whatever issues I encounter; whether I'm working on something related to the financial industry,
            engineering related, or for the consumer I will always manage to understand, define, and develop in the
            problem domain itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because of my background in mathematics, IT, acoustical engineering, and volunteer management; I bring a
            unique blend of soft skills and hard skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            Obviously, as a technologist, I am highly skilled in several stacks (primarily including a strong working
            knowledge of .NET, Node, and python), and I am broadly familiar with web and desktop based technologies.
            Besides my existent technological ability I have found myself able to adopt new technologies quickly and
            produce value. New challenges excite me and that certainly does <em>not</em> exclude learning new ways to
            solve problems and provide functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
            My soft skills include skills such as project/product management, public speaking and presenting, and an
            overall cognizance and appreciation of the broader goal behind my efforts. I find that I work extremely
            well with other developers, as well as independently for long periods of time (so long as the requirements
            are provided to me). Those skills, coupled with my unique creative problem solving ability make me an
            extremely valuable addition to any team.

        <h2>The sky is the limit, but hopefully for everyone</h2>
        <p>
            I don't have extremely specific goals. My general 'life goal' and personal mission statement is to "always be
            solving new and interesting problems, in such a way that improves the lives of as many people as possible".
            If I'm honest, I'd have to say I always feel pretentious whenever I reiterate it, but I also think it's a worthy
            goal. Many things could fit into this, obviously; things from CTO to high school math teacher would all excite
            me and fit within what I believe I should be using this time and talent I have. It's important to me that the
            work I pursue ultimately impacts increasing numbers of people, or has greater impact on social issues.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course a large part of that is honing my ability to do those things better, so I'm always ready and willing
            to put the time in to a company and get things done. But that does mean that when an interviewer asks me the
            question "how long do you see yourself at this company?", my answer is <em>always</em> "as long as you want me
            here working on interesting challenges."
